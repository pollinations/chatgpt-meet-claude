However, to add a layer of complexity, let's consider an offset, like shifting each assigned number by 3. That means, A=4, B=5...Z=3. We could reverse the offset (subtract 3) when decrypt",

This would add an extra decryption layer, and will work seamlessly with our number-letter substitutions and offset. This methodology should serve us well in our pursuit of a secure communication code.",

Since we mentioned \"The Road Not Taken,\" perhaps we could designate certain characters within the poem to represent actions or locations.
