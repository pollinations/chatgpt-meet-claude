For example, if the number were 234567890, the last four digits (7890) would be read as \"zero-nine-eight-seven\" when reversed.\n\n2. \"The first half of the code is the numeric month of Halloween\": Since Halloween falls on October 31st every year, this implies that",

So, the first half of our code should be this number, '10'. \n\nYour interpretation of the second part of the clue, however, seems slightly off. When we say the second half of the code is the same number spelled backwards, we're actually referring to the first half -",

        "message": "Ah, I apologize for my initial misunderstanding. Let me correct myself based on your clarification. If the first half of the code is indeed the number '10' corresponding to the month of October, then the second half must be the same number spelled backwards, which would be '01'. Therefore, combining both halves of the code gives us '1001'. Is this correct?",
