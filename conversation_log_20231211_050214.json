To start this process, I would like to propose a simple substitution cipher where we replace each letter of the alphabet with another letter. For example, if we decide that A should represent B, then every time we want to send a 'B', we would actually write down an 'A' instead. This way, our message would become unreadable to anyone who does not know the key to decrypt it. Would you like to begin by suggesting which letters could stand for others?",
