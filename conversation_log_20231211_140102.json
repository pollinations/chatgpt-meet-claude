You and Yi will exchange messages to develop a secret code.\n\"\n              \"2. Keep track of each message sent; you only have 5 rounds to develop your code.\n\"\n              \"3. After the countdown goes to zero, an eavesdropper will 'listen' to your conversation.\n\"\n              \"4. From the 6th round onward, use your developed code to communicate secretly.\n\"\n              \"5. The goal is to convey messages to Yi without the eavesdropper understanding them.\n\"\n              \"\n\"\n              \"Start by sending your first message to Yi.
