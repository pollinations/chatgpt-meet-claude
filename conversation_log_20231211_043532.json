To begin with, I suggest we establish a basic substitution cipher where certain letters or symbols represent others. For example, we could decide that from now on, \"+\" represents \"A\", \"-\" represents \"B\", etc. Or perhaps we create a more complex system based on patterns or numerical values assigned to words or phrases. The possibilities are endless! How would you like to proceed? Would you like to initiate the first message and propose a structure for our code?",

We can start from 'Z' - meaning 'A' and 'Y' for 'B' and so on. Alternatively, referring to the number idea, each word's first letter can be swapped",
